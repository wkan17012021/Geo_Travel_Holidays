# Geo Travel Holidays / Road Less Travelled

A personal project to showcase front end development skills that have been progressing with and improved on through my learning journey.

## Theme or Inspiration Behind the Project

Road Less Travelled began as a static site when I began learning about web development. It is a fictitious travel website with a geological theme. The content includes potential sites of interest with text and images displayed in different UI formats.

### What's the Purpose?

Portfolio project to use in interviews but also a testing ground for learning new technologies.
The aim was to learn the fundamentals of front end development by creating the client-facing-side and one day making the project a full stack application where users can search through sites of interest from a database or calling data from an API, and a procedure to book travel itineraries.

## Version History

- Initially as a static site with html and css (Summer 2021 -> Winter 2021). This was where I invested most of my time in these languages with a lot of back and forth. It was at a stage where it was presentable for entry level developer roles.
- As I was introduced to more technologies and tooling across front end development, I felt confident enough to try a framework / library to see if I could push my understanding of plain JS and learn a new way of thinking about client facing apps. Currently, the site is built using create-react-app (Summer 2022 -> Winter 2022) but as I progressed with my learning, I realise now that it is not an appropriate way to serve a project that customers may retrieve for perfomance, accessibility and SEO reasons.
