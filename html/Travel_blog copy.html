    <p class="Batur_text">Climbing the slopes of Mt. Batur around 4am to catch the sunrise was worth it for this once in a lifetime view. 
        The volcano is a UNESCO Global Geopark, located in northeast Bali, Indonesia. Batur is an active 
        stratovolcano, with steep slopes developed by viscous lava and ejecta from previous eruptions. 
        The volcano contains an inner lake or inner caldera formed due to eruption and upon expelling magma, the volcano
        collapses leaving a vast depression.</p>

        <h2>Colorado River</h2>

            <img class="cover_photo_horseshoe" src="../images/Colorado River Horshoe Bend Lookout (2).jpg" height="600px">
                <div class="horseshoe_text">
                    <p>Overlooking the Colorado at Horseshoe Bend reminded me of the Wild West- the very first travellers
                        must have felt a sense of freedom traversing this vast wilderness as they neared the end of the plateau, and marvelling
                        at this view below some 300m to the river level. This is a textbook example of an incised meander. As the Colorado
                        River snakes its way through massive Navajo Sandstone, it deposits sediment on the inner bank which is slow moving 
                        compared to the outer bend of the river where the faster flowing water erodes away at the rock. Over time, the river 
                        migrates and meanders downstream. Fluvial systems are dynamic, what you see today maybe gone tomorrow- so remember to 
                        take a photo and mind the gap!</p>

        <h2>Antelope Canyon</h2>
    <div class="container_antelope">
    <div class="antelope_text">
            <p>If you are fortunate enough to explore Horseshoe Bend, then Antelope Canyon is well worth a visit nearby.
        This is a geological curiosity comprising a sinuous path carved out by the elements over millenia. 
        Although the passage through the canyon is narrow, it was formed by intermittent flash flooding events eroding
        the massive Navajo Sandstone. What can be seen today is a marvel of striated and cross-bedded sandstone walls, 
        polished by the wind. The site is famous for lighting and shadows cast across the canyon walls.</p>

        <p class="Golden_Gate_Text">Taking in the sights and sounds of the Greater Bay Area and of course the Golden Gate Bridge, 
            a impressive feat of engineering to stand the test of time. The suspension bridge connects San Francisco to Marin 
            County, California across the strait where the Bay Area meets the Pacific Ocean. A suspension bridge consists of
            a main deck connected to the vertical suspenders which are in turn, connected to the main cables running from 
            one tower to another and any anchors at the ends of the bridge. The load of the main deck transfers tension on 
            the vertical suspenders and the main cables. The towers are in compression as the load is transferred from 
            the main cables, through the towers and finally into the foundation rock composed of sandstone, shale, chert, 
            basalt and serpentinite of the Franciscan Complex.</p>

        <p class="Zhangye_text">This geopark is located in Zhangye, Gansu Province, China. This picturesque landscape is popular for its 
            contrasting pattern of coloured hills which it gets from alternating layers of iron-rich, red sandstone
            and other layers with less iron. Tectonic compressional forces were present to create the steep inclination 
            of these colourful hills.</p>

        <p class="South_France_text">A whole webpsite could be dedicated to geological sites in Southern France, but there is only space
            to share a small collection of must-see spots. Of these, Gorge du Verdon can be enjoyed 
            simply driving through this valley. This photo of a partial tunnel &lpar;with people for scale&rpar;
            reveals the limestone bedrock with a considerable overhang as the road passes beneath it. The Verdon River
            feeds into the artifical Sainte-Croix lake, created in conjunction with the arch dam with the same name.
            This area is famous for its steeply dipping limestone beds, the turquoise waters and white sand beaches.
            Finally, Pont du Gard near Avignon, is a Roman aqueduct comprised of three rows of vertical arches made from
            limestone quarried nearby and is approximately 48 metres high.</p>

    <h2>Iceland</h2>

        <img class="Cover_Photo_Iceland" src="..//images/Reynisfjara Beach (13).jpg" height="600px">
        <div class="Container_Iceland_Text">
            <p>Travellers should make a pit-stop at Reynisfjara Beach if they are travelling in Iceland. Perhaps what makes 
            this place so special, is the distinctive black sand which formed from basaltic lava eruptions which cooled 
            quickly upon contact with the sea. This dramatic change in temperature creates a brittle material and shatters 
            into smaller sand-size grains of basalt which currently litter the beach. Taking a stroll along this coastal
            section, it's hard to miss then near-perfect, often hexagonal basalt columns which tower above the beach 
            &lpar;with people for scale&rpar;. Columnar jointing is typically formed when basaltic lava cools from the 
            outside as it is exposed to the elements. This cooling process creates cracks on the surface which propogate 
            out in symetric patterns if the chemistry of the lava is consistent. These cooling cracks that originate on 
            the lava surface begin to extend vertically into the lava body as it gradually cools slowly forming these 
            vast columns. Word of warning- try not to stand too close to the columns as rockfalls can happen. Review the 
            <a href="https://www.worldbeachguide.com/iceland/reynisfjara-beach-weather.htm" target="Blank">tidal information</a>
