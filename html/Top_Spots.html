A UNESCO Global Geopark, located in northeast Bali, Indonesia, Batur is an active stratovolcano, with steep slopes formed by viscous lava and ejecta from previous eruptions. The volcano contains an inner lake or inner caldera formed due to eruption and upon expelling magma, the volcano collapses leaving a vast depression. Besides volcano hikes, Bali is famous for surfing, snorkling, beach walks, nightlife and has recently become popular amongst <span class="links"><a href="https://outandbeyond.com/bali-digital-nomad/" target="Blank">digital nomads.</a></span>

                <div class="horseshoe_text">
                    <p>Overlooking the Colorado at Horseshoe Bend serves as a reminder of the Wild West- the early travellers must have felt a sense of freedom traversing this vast landscape especially as they neared the end of the plateau, and marvelling at this view below some 300m to river level. This is a textbook example of an incised meander. As the Colorado River snakes its way through massive Navajo Sandstone, it deposits sediment on the inner bank which is slow moving compared to the outer bend of the river where the faster flowing water erodes away at the rock. Over time, the river migrates and meanders downstream. Fluvial systems are dynamic, what you see today maybe gone tomorrow- so remember to take a photo and watch your footing!</p>

                    <p>If you are fortunate enough to explore Horseshoe Bend, then Antelope Canyon is well worth a visit, about 9 miles away. This is definitely a geological wonder comprising a sinuous path carved out by the elements over millenia. As the passage through the canyon can be narrow and uneven, take care with your footing and always remain close to your travelling party. Antelope Canyon was formed by intermittent flash flooding events eroding the massive Navajo Sandstone. What can be seen today is a marvel of striated and cross-bedded sedimentary features in the sandstone walls, polished by the wind. The site is famous for photography as the sun light and shadows cast eerie yet beautiful shapes across the canyon walls.</p>

This <span class="links"><a href="https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-does-a-suspension-bridge-work" target="blank">suspension bridge</a></span> connects San Francisco to Marin County, California across the strait where the Bay Area meets the Pacific Ocean. A suspension bridge consists of a main deck connected to the vertical suspenders which are in turn, connected to the main cables running from one tower to another and any anchors at the ends of the bridge. The load of the main deck transfers tension on the vertical suspenders and the main cables. The towers are in compression as the load is transferred from the main cables, through the towers and finally into the foundation rock which is composed of sandstone, shale, chert, basalt and serpentinite of the Franciscan Complex.</p>

                <p class="zhangye_text">This geopark is located in Zhangye, Gansu Province, China. The panorama shown at the top of the page is typical of this picturesque landscape, popular for its alternating pattern of coloured hills which it gets from layers of iron-rich, red sandstone and other layers with less iron content. Tectonic compressional forces were responsible for creating the steep inclination of these colourful hills.<br>This photo however, is of PingShan also in Zhangye Geopark. It's considered the "Grand Canyon" of China and offers approximately an hour and a half hike from the canyon floor to the surface level with numerous vistas and vantage points. Once again, the geology is sandstone units and conglomerate with variable iron content giving the distintive red 'rust' discolouration. Prepare for the hike with studry walking boots, bottled water and your camera!</p>

This photo of a partial tunnel &lpar;with people for scale&rpar; reveals limestone bedrock with a considerable overhang as the road passes beneath it. The Verdon River feeds into the artifical Sainte-Croix lake, created in conjunction with the arch dam with the same name. This area is famous for its steeply dipping limestone beds, the turquoise waters and white sand beaches. Finally, Pont du Gard near Avignon, is a Roman aqueduct comprised of three rows of vertical arches made from limestone quarried nearby and is approximately 48 metres high.</p>

                <div class="iceland_text">
                    <p>Perhaps what makes Reynisfjara Beach so special, is the distinctive black sand which formed from basaltic lava eruptions which cooled quickly upon contact with the sea. This dramatic change in temperature creates a brittle material and shatters into smaller sand-size grains of basalt which currently litter the beach. Taking a stroll along this coast, it's hard to miss the near-perfect, hexagonal basalt columns which tower above the beach &lpar;with people for scale&rpar;. Columnar jointing is typically formed when basaltic lava cools from the outside as it is exposed to the elements. This cooling process creates cracks on the surface which propogate out in symetric patterns if the chemistry of the lava is consistent. These cooling cracks that originate on the lava surface begin to extend vertically into the lava body as it gradually cools slowly forming these vast columns. Word of warning- try not to stand too close to the columns or beneath them as rockfalls can happen.
